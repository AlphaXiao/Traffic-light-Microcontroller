# Traffic Light
## INTRODUCTION
> In recent years, as science and technology progressed, the application of **microcontrollers** became increasingly sophisticated while driving the traditional control and detection technology into real-time detection and automatic control of the **microcontroller application system**. Because the microcontroller is frequently used as a core component, knowledge of the microcontroller alone is insufficient; knowledge of the specific hardware structure of the combinator is also necessary. Crossroadsâ€™ cars shuttle, people bustle, automobile lanes, pedestrian walkways, are orderly, but how does this orderly order come about? The automated command system is represented by the traffic signal. There are several methods for controlling traffic lights. This system employs the 51 series microcontroller 80C51 as the core control device to design the traffic signal controller, which enables the function of bright green light to pass, bright yellow light flashing and sounding a warning, bright red light to stop the passage of the function and displaying the passage or stopping the passage of the countdown, as well as the emergency button signal lights to add time and emergency button north and south, east and west traffic light jump. The system is simple to use, simple to run, and simple to implement; it also has a robust extension mechanism, which allows you to alter the software to achieve the tasks you need.
